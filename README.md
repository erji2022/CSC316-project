## Project Overview

**Our Planet at a Crossroads** is an immersive web experience designed to educate users about the environmental impact
of human activity. Using data from NASA, WHO, and other reputable sources, the project presents visual narratives on:

- **Climate Change:** Global temperature anomalies alongside CO₂ levels and sea level rise.
- **Air Quality:** An interactive tree map and line charts comparing pollutant metrics (PM2.5, NO₂, PM10) by region or
  country.
- **Plastic Waste:** A pie chart visualizing waste management categories.
- **Water Quality:** A heatmap showing pH trends over time with interactive filtering.

---

## Key Features

- **Scroll-Driven Narrative:** Seamless navigation with dot indicators and smooth scrolling between themed pages.
- **Dynamic Visualizations:**
    - **Combined Chart:** Merges temperature, CO₂, and sea level data into one interactive visualization.
    - **Air Quality Tree Map:** Sorts air quality metrics with options to view data by country or region.
    - **Plastic Waste Pie Chart:** Visualizes proportions of different waste management methods.
    - **Water Quality Heatmap:** Displays pH level trends with year-range filters and detailed tooltips.
- **Responsive Design:** Automatically adapts to different screen sizes with dynamic resizing for charts and tooltips.
- **Rich Interactivity:** Hover effects, filtering options, and sorting controls allow users to explore detailed data
  insights.

### File Descriptions

- **`index.html`:**  
  The main HTML file that brings together all components of the interactive experience. It loads Bootstrap, D3.js, and
  the custom JavaScript modules.

- **`css/style.css`:**  
  Contains styling for layout, typography, color schemes, and responsive behaviors.

- **`js/main.js`:**  
  Orchestrates the initialization of individual pages and the scroll navigation manager.

- **Visualization Modules (inside `js/`):**  
  Each file (e.g., `airQualityChart.js`, `CombinedChart.js`, `pH.js`, `pieChart.js`) handles the loading, processing,
  and rendering of its corresponding data visualization. These modules include interactivity like tooltips, filtering,
  and sorting.

- **Page Modules (`page0.js` – `page5.js`):**  
  These files are responsible for initializing and managing content for each specific page of the interactive narrative.
  Each page module sets up its unique DOM elements, binds necessary event listeners, and calls upon visualization
  modules as needed. This modular structure ensures that each section of the story (from introduction through
  conclusion) is handled independently, keeping the code organized and maintainable.

## Detailed Interactions

**Scroll Navigation & Dot Indicators:**

- The custom scroll manager (`scroll.js`) handles smooth transitions between pages and updates dot indicators to show
  the current section.

**Climate Change Visualizations (Page 1):**

- **CombinedChart.js:**  
  Integrates temperature anomalies (bars), CO₂ levels (line with circles), and sea level rise (line). Tooltips provide
  detailed values, and an internal legend explains the metrics.

**Air Quality Trends (Page 2):**

- **airQualityChart.js:**  
  Uses a tree map to display air quality data, with node sizes representing pollutant levels. A dropdown enables sorting
  by PM2.5, NO₂, or PM10 and toggling between country and region views. Clicking on a node updates an associated line
  chart with historical trends.

**Plastic Waste Visualization (Page 3):**

- **pieChart.js:**  
  Displays waste management categories (recycled, incinerated, landfilled, mismanaged, and littered) in a pie chart.
  Hover interactions reveal percentage details and a legend clarifies the color scheme.

**Water Quality Analysis (Page 4):**

- **pH.js:**  
  Renders a heatmap showing average water pH values by station over selected year ranges. A dropdown filter allows users
  to focus on specific time periods, and tooltips display station-specific details.

**Final Reflection & Call-to-Action (Page 5):**

- Summarizes key insights from all visualizations.
- Provides a “Restart Story” button to re-experience the narrative.
- Encourages users to learn more and take actionable steps toward sustainability.
